  <p>
    I'm learning Web Development through online courses and self-teaching.
    I found my interest in WebDev when writing my class notes in Obsidian; a note-taking tool utilizing the Markdown language.
    Some limitations of the language led me to find solutions that often entailed writing HTML, sparking a fire that made me want more. <br/>
